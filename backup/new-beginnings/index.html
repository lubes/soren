            <p>
                Dear friends &amp; colleagues,
            </p>
            <p>
                I have some exciting news! After more than 20 years with ATOMIC, the time to step away from this extraordinary company has come. As of 1/1/17, I will be on to the next thing, no longer an officer or employee of ATOMIC.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Looking back</strong> over these last two decades, I am extremely grateful for my partnership with Tom McPhillips; his trust in me and the opportunities he afforded me have been absolutely amazing! In more recent years Daniel McPhillips
                has done a magnificent job of building an operational backbone for the company providing strength and stability that will serve ATOMIC well for years to come. The senior leadership group is a mature, cohesive unit responsible for executing
                strategy and making happy, happy clients; they are the best in the biz and it is my confidence in them that allows me to dream of a new venture knowing that ATOMIC will continue to thrive! My fondest memories are from the early years,
                when I was deep in the trenches, winging it with this incredible team of talent, making cool things happen every day. It has been my honor and pleasure to work with everyone on Team ATOMIC, and with YOU. You have my eternal thanks for
                the rich journey we shared over these years.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Looking forward</strong> I am excited to begin developing entertainment properties from the ground up and investing in creative companies that will contribute to the process. I look forward to sharing more news with you as the
                adventure unfolds. In the short term, I will continue to serve as executive producer for Turner. Karen and I will be based in Aspen for much of the winter where I will be busy laying the foundation for plans that I look forward to sharing
                with you. After that, we plan to split our time between LA, NYC, and Aspen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, please find new contact information. Please feel free to contact me, or anyone at ATOMIC with any questions. I am excited for the day our paths cross again. Until then, thank you and be well.
            </p>
